Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) is a standardized, high quality lossy audio codec, designed as the successor to the MP3 
format.  AAC is now one of the most widely deployed audio codecs, and such names as the iTunes Store distribute music in the AAC format.

# Features

- Supports AAC Low Complexity Profile (which is the most common profile)
- Support for the Main, High Efficiency (Spectral Band Replication) and High Efficiency v2 (Spectral Band Replication + Parametric Stereo) profiles is planned
- Other profiles, such as the low delay, and error resilient profiles are not supported, PRs are welcome!
